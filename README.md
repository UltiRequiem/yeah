# Yeah

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/UltiRequiem/yeah)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/UltiRequiem/yeah)

Output a string repeatedly until killed.

Yet Another
[`yes`](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/yes.c) clone but
in Golang.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/UltiRequiem/yeah@latest
```

Or use a binary from
[releases](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/yeah/releases/latest).

## Usage

Just like [`yes`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(Unix)):

```sh
yeah
```

> This will print "y" until the process is canceled.

You can also pass a custom string to repeat:

```sh
yeah custom string
```

> This will print "custom string" until the process is canceled.
